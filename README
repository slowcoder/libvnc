A very simplistic VNC server, demonstrating just how easy it is to implement a VNC server.

Specification followed: RFB 3.8 (http://www.realvnc.com/docs/rfbproto.pdf)

Lots of stuff is missing (compression, hooks for handlers, etc), but
is done this way to keep the source simple.

TCP functions are also broken out to keep the source simple.
